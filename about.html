<p>
    When you visit our little part of the world wide web, we want you to feel comfortable in the kitchen
 we’ve spent countless hours dreaming up flavorful and creative recipes so you can enjoy the best food at home too.
 Whether you’re eating meatless just on Mondays or are vegan for life, we’ve got tons of ideas for you. Need more convincing? Check out our 100+ vegan recipes—there’s something in here for everyone, for every meal of the day.
Don't get us wrong—we're serious about food. If you've come here to finally tackle a sourdough recipe, we'll break down the (ahem, very laborious) technique, step by step.</p>
<p>
    We equally celebrate those who love to cook and those who just really love to eat. Wherever you fall on that spectrum, you'll find your people here. So come get to know us—the team behind Delish. Meet the people who work hard to bring you the recipes, stories, and videos you see every month. We want you to love cooking from and spending time on Delish as much as we love creating this space for you, so engage with us: rate your favorite recipes, leave a comment on how it went, and be sure to save all the delicious-looking things you come across that you can't wait to make.
